Progress Stage: <em><strong>Basic</strong></em>

## <u>Files</u>:
- emoji-sequences.txt
- emoji-test.txt
- emoji-zwj-sequences.txt
- label_data.py

## <u>Usage:</u>
- run the label_data.py file to generate a <strong>Data_File.csv</strong> file, it has all the categories, topics and emojis listed.

<em><strong>Note:</strong></em> This test has only been made for <strong>emoji-zwj-sequences.txt</strong> file.
Other text files, also same similar data formats and data can be extracted using same code.(or by making some nescessary tweaks)

### <u>What Should be the Next Step?</u>
<ol>
	<li>I have thoughts on making a sqlite3 database with the data.</li>
	<li>Making the data more systematic.</li>
	<li>And making it more adequate for processing.</li>
</ol>
